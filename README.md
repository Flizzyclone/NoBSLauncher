# NoBSLauncher
No BS Launcher is a basic launcher for the game Hearts of Iron IV. The launcher is used for enabling DLC/Mods and launching the game in either debug or normal mode.

## Capabilities
1. Launch the game in either debug or normal mode.
2. Can be used without Steam open.
3. Launches quick, doesn't take forever to load your mods.
4. No ads or bloat that use system resources.

## Limitations
1. Cannot detect new mods from the Steam Workshop, if you've just downloaded a mod and it's not showing up, start the normal launcher. The mod will then appear in this launcher.
2. If your game is not installed through Steam, the program will ask you where your .exe is every time. This is deliberate to not store anything in the registry/on your PC.
3. Cannot set launch arguments other than -debug.
